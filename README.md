# Full Stack Web Development Notes

## About 
This website is built for those beginning on their web development journey. It's meant to be used as a guideline/cheat sheet for beginners. As someone who is also starting out, I can empathize with those who are overwhelmed with the lareg volume of information that one needs to learn to make even a simple static website. I kept finding myself wishing that I had a cheat sheet to refer to as I learned about the different components that built a website. 

Thus, I decided to build my own website that walks beginners through the high-level overview of web development, what a browser is and how it's different from servers and websites, and any other helpful tips for beginner developers. 

If you notice any errors or room for improvement, please send me a message. I am always looking to improve my website, and of course to learn more ways to become a better developer.
